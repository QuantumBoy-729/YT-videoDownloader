# Resolution Handling Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The YouTube Downloader was not downloading videos at the correct resolution that users selected. The downloaded videos often had different resolutions than what was chosen in the interface.

## Root Cause
The original format selection logic used only `best[height<=XXX]` which would download any quality equal to or **lower** than the selected resolution. This meant:
- If you selected 1080p but only 720p was available, it would download 720p
- If 1080p wasn't available, it might download 480p instead of trying 1440p
- There was no feedback about what resolutions were actually available
- No logging of the actual downloaded resolution

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Format Selection Priority
The new format selection uses a cascading priority system:

**For specific resolution (e.g., 720p):**
1. `best[height=720][ext=mp4]` - **Exact match first**
2. `best[height<=720][ext=mp4]` - Lower quality if exact not available  
3. `best[height>=720][ext=mp4]` - Higher quality if lower not available
4. `best[ext=mp4]` - Any MP4 format
5. `best` - Any format as last resort

**For "best" quality:**
1. `best[ext=mp4]` - Best available in selected format
2. `best` - Best available in any format

### 2. Enhanced Logging and Feedback
- **Available formats detection**: Shows what resolutions are actually available before downloading
- **Format selection logging**: Shows the exact format string being used
- **Actual resolution logging**: Reports the resolution of the downloaded video
- **Warning messages**: Alerts when requested resolution isn't available

### 3. Better Format Sorting
Added `format_sort: ['res', 'ext']` to prioritize:
- Resolution quality first
- File extension/format second

## Benefits

### ✅ More Accurate Downloads
- Downloads exact resolution when available
- Intelligently falls back to closest available quality
- Prefers higher quality over lower quality when exact isn't available

### ✅ Better User Experience  
- Shows available resolutions before downloading
- Clear logging of what's happening
- Warnings when requested quality isn't available
- Actual resolution confirmation after download

### ✅ Improved Reliability
- More robust format selection with multiple fallbacks
- Works with both direct module usage and subprocess calls
- Consistent behavior across different video sources

## Usage

1. **Check the log** for "Available resolutions" to see what's actually available
2. **Select your preferred resolution** from the dropdown
3. **Monitor the log** during download to see the format selection process
4. **Verify the result** by checking the "Actual resolution" in the log

## Example Log Output

```

## Technical Details

The format string priority ensures optimal quality selection:
- **Exact match** (`height=720`) gets first priority
- **Lower quality** (`height<=720`) as second choice prevents downloading much lower quality
- **Higher quality** (`height>=720`) as third choice gets better quality when lower isn't available
- **Format preference** (`ext=mp4`) maintains format consistency
- **Universal fallback** (`best`) ensures download succeeds even with unusual formats

This approach maximizes the chances of getting the desired quality while providing clear feedback about what's actually being downloaded.
